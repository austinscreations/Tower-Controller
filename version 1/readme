Readme for version 1

This version was created as I was testing a concept. I had intended to add an esp-01 to the arduino nano.
I wasn't able ot have reliable communication through teh essp-10 so version 2 will use a wemos d1 mini at it's core.

version 1 was hand soldered and 5mm led sat with in a 3d printed insert. The lenses were made with a 3d printed mold filed with epoxy resin 
i used cheap dollar store resin as a test and didn't wnat to use my high quality stuff. and used resin tint for the colors.

The LEDS match the lens color - I found this gives the best results as using the white leds on the color produced a washed out color.


COMPUTER ASSEMBLY - 
holder - this was a holder i made taht slides over my dual monitor mount post, it has a sleep and reset button along with lcd display spot.

sleep was used for when i'd go to bed as the arduino nano has control over the door bell sound it will play the sound every so often until i wake up and reset it.
   good for me as I'm partly deaf. it would also turn off the screen so tah tmy room would be dark for sleeping
reset is used to reset the screen notification and intern reset a color on the tower if needed.

led panel is the panel used to insert 5mm leds and solder them together with resisters.

tower light cover is teh back cover for teh assembly, i glued mine in place, pased etehrnet cable thru the hole for the led wiring

tower light is the main tower assembly.

LENS - 

lens mold is parts a nad b, they were alligned and hot glue at the seam. mann mold release 200 was used to prevent the resin from sticking.

lens shaper - i would allow the lens to mostly cure and still be flexible (warning teh resin wil lstill be warm in this state - i'd remove it from teh mold and place it within the shaper
this ensured that the lens was easy to remove from the mold and any moving it did coming out of teh mold gave it a chance to cure in the correct shape. found this gave me the best results
and with the use of 5 minute epoxy gave me chance to make lenses really quickly.
