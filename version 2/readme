Version 2 

This version has the tower assembly using 5730 LEd's for lighting and a spot on the pcb for a wemos D1 mini.

***this version is larger than the v1 so taht both the 180 degree and 360 degree assebbilies can be the same size.***

Requires 12v power to run - diode proetcting 5v regualtor when programming via usb

will be updated as I create the PCB files, code and 3d housings will be made and adjusted once I order parts for assembly and testing.

updated control board pcb in version 2 stacking edition
added intial 3d model photo of teh 3d printable model that will be used to assemble the lights

added photos of the pcb designs of each version
added cost breakdown in main version 22 folder for each version. doesn't include 3d printed parts / power supply - using ebay canada as source

Created new files. there are different assemblies. 

180 version = has a single led panel with wemos d1 mini - giving ~180 degree ilumination

360 stacking = used a control board and led boards - using brass stand offs to conenct each baord. there are solder jumpers which are to be used to route the signal
for the ws2811s chip that controls the led mosfets. the depending on led color you need 82 ohm or 39 ohm 2010 1 watt resistors (text on pcb). 
each baord will allow you to program 3 segment animations on the led baord. 3d printed parts with 45 degree angles nad chrome paint can be used to redirect light.

360 version = uses 4 straight led panels to connect to a control board via 90 degree headers. uses ws2811s chip to control LED mosfets

Boards are currently untested and don't have 3d assembly files, working on multiple projects and home to do a mass ebay order to fill parts on these projects to keep my costs down.

Hope to expore the option of a POE powered and ethernet controlled tower
