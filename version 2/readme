Version 2 

This version has the tower assembly using 5730 LEd's for lighting and a spot on the pcb for a wemos D1 mini.

so far the 180 degree version has been made with 5 layer and 3 layer lighting. these should fit within the version 1 housing, 
but the usb cable goes down and there isn't a hole in the 3d model for the reset button

next updates will include a 360 degree version (multiple PCB's)

versions after that will explore having POE powered option.

all can be power with 5v usb but also has pads for an exteral power conenctor (eg2.1mm jack)

will be updated as i create the pCB files, code and 3d housings will be made and adjusted once I order parts for assembly and testing.

noticed issues, removed oringal v2 designs will re-upload when I make changes
